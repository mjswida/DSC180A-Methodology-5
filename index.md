**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** 

It's been interesting to learn about how we can adapt existing code to make the labeling software we're looking to use for our .wav files.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

My understanding of what we're doing is that we're going to see how airplanes affect the frequency of bird calls. I think it would be cool to see how it breaks down by species. I had a discussion with a grad student we've been working with and we were discussing how smart crows and ravens are, so it would be cool to see if they are more or less affected by the planes.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

We spent a lot of time trying to get an existing labeling software to work that just didn't work for about 5 weeks and we came to the conclusion it just wasn't going to work. I wish we'd abandoned that software sooner and started building our own, because it seems like it's a really interesting and useful thing to learn and we would've been able to start machine learning tasks this quarter or at least earlier than we will now.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I'm interested to see how the machine learning tasks work once we've gotten some stuff labeled. I haven't really done any deep learning before, so it will be cool to start learning the basics of that.
